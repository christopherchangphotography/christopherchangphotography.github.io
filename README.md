# Project Title

Random Pics by Chris Chang

## Description

This repository serves as the codebase for Chris Chang's database of photos

## Getting Started

In terminal, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/christopherchangphotography/christopherchangphotography.github.io.git
```

Then, navigate to the project folder labeled christopherchangphotography/christopherchangphotography.github.io; this is where the code lies. To add images to the site, navigate to the images folder, and add the photo to both the "fulls" folder and the "thumbs" folder (make sure they are in the same order!).

Now that the code is updated locally, we must do update Github. To do this, run: 
```
git add -A && git commit -m "[some message]" && git push 
```

Wait 5 minutes and you're good to go!
